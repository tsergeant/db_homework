 JDBC In-Class Exercise
------------------------
In this exercise you will practice establishing a connection to the
csci.hsutx.edu server and writing a JDBC program on it.


1) Establish an ssh connection to your csci.hsutx.edu account. Do all remaining
steps from that command-line interface.

2) Download the DBDemo4.java program from josephus. You can use this command:

wget https://josephus.sergeantservices.com/classes/db/source/DBDemo4.java

3) Rename DBDemo4.java to ICE.java. (mv DBDemo4.java ICE.java)

4) Using vim or nano to edit ICE.java. Rename the class to ICE.

5) Using vim/nano Create a file called dbconnect.txt and put the
following data into it:

org.postgresql.Driver
jdbc:postgresql://csci.hsutx.edu/demo_db
demo
welovethisclass

6) Compile and run ICE.java and verify it is working for you:

javac ICE.java
java ICE

7) Once you have ICE.java working you should make the following
modifications to the program. Test each step before moving on to the
next one.

	a) Modify dbconnect.txt so you will connect to your database rather
	than the demo. Modify ICE.java so that you perform a valid query
	from the booksdb schema. You will also need to modify the code that
	processes the query results.

	b) Change ICE.java so it only uses positional notation. When printing
	each entry use a for-loop to cycle through the individual fields. For
	example, suppose your query returns 4 columns. Then create a for-loop
	that cycles 4 times and put the print statement inside the loop.

	c) Modify ICE.java so that it sends a query that joins all three tables
	in the booksdb schema. Also modify your for loop to pick up all the columns.

8) Thank you for playing!
